## Why?

Searching the keyword `paystack` on npm's package registry returns 126 search
results of paystack related projects from client packages to CLIs to framework
related packages as at the time of the writing of this documentation, certainly
the number will continue to go up because there will always be people who like
to build stuff and people who think what is out there can be made better.

As a self taught developer with a python background, somewhere around 2016 when
I was still very much a noob(I still am üòÇ, just cooler), I had a website i was
building at the time in Django that needed payment integrations. I had limited
knowledge of how things worked but I was able to get the feature to work in my
spaghetti code with the help of a package called
[Pypaystack](https://github.com/edwardpopoola/pypaystack). It was magic for me
because i had previously used `requests` in python which is similar to what
`axios` and `fetch` api does but for the python ecosystem and I hated it because
I was suffering from severe skill issue. That little abstraction of providing
functions and methods that encapsulated all the implementations details needed
to make an api call made all the difference for me as a beginner. It's safe to
say that the author of that package was my hero as this became my go to package
when I needed payment integration. Over the years, the project was no longer
actively maintained and I experienced this issue where the package breaks my web
apps when I tried to deploy it on Heroku (they still had a free tier then, good
times üòÆ‚Äçüí®). Looking for the fix, I stumbled upon an open issue
[https://github.com/edwardpopoola/pypaystack/issues/11](https://github.com/edwardpopoola/pypaystack/issues/11)
for the setback i was experiencing. It was as a result of how the project was
published, it used a `setup.py` file which was an old but still valid method of
publishing a python package. I was pushing for using a new tool at the time
called `poetry` to simplify the publishing of the package (cool tools have come
after like `uv` which i think is the coolest now) but was unable to get to the
maintainer of the project after numerous attempts. I looked at other projects
but i experienced issues like the other packages I tried out didn't work, there
wasn't enough documentation on how to us them or the package had methods with
camel case instead of snake case which is the norm in the python ecosystem. Sure
`PaystackClient.miscellaneous.getBanks` looks cool in in a javascript code, I
don't want to have to type that as a python developer, but this is not a story
about python. I later had to fork `Pypaystack`, copied parts of it's code that
were relevant to my needs and the job is done. I remember making a
[youtube video](https://youtu.be/MrqWC1ByqKo?si=qvkDrXF6RiFT4ElS) of this hack.
It was a bad idea looking back because i had to copy the package for every new
project i was working on but it worked.

I got my first professional developer role in July of 2022 which shaped and
refined me. It was and still is overwhelming and requires me to push beyond my
bounds. My typical self would shy away from the hard stuff which is not really a
great trait for a developer. The nature of the job is problem solving and it's
the most challenging part for me (my boss complains about it sometimes). I
probably learnt how to avoid trouble so well that I need to unlearn it or I took
quotes like "When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when
information grows unprofitable, sleep." or "Don't try" by Charles Bukowski out
of context. All days weren't entirely bad days, I've had my fair share of good
days when I think to myself, this has to be the best job in the world. While
working, I had to work with `requests` that I avoided and got pretty comfortable
with it. It was then I went back to the source code for `Pypaystack` and how it
worked made sense to me, so i decided to work on an official fork which led to
the creation of [Pypaystack2](https://gray-adeyi.github.io/pypaystack2/). There
were a lot of similar packages as stated earlier but it was a leaning process
for me, I made some mistakes, I tried some new things like building a CLI and
adding async support, My profession job has once required me to write a little
bit of GO (I didn't do amazingly well and had to work on another task but the
language stuck, I definitely want to be decent in the language someday). So I
thought to myself why not write a GO version which I did, then for dart (I still
don't know flutter to this day üò≠). Currently, my day job requires me to write a
lot of javascript which lead to me challenging myself to create this project. I
probably should stop writing client libraries and start working on those hard
projects i've left incomplete.

Now that you have enough context as to what drives me, Here's my why.

1. **I do it because i love doing it.** I love to see that something i built,
   works for someone else. The number of downloads and stars gives me chills
   like i have a place in this world. After a shitty day at work when my boss's
   expectations of me are high and I don't meetup those demands, I look to other
   things that I've done that are working as a motivation to try again, it's
   just a skill issue. And so that i don't start considering other career paths
   when the python bites me üòÇ, or start believing what Github Roast AI says
   [about me](https://github-roast.pages.dev/share/gray-adeyi/?lang=english)
2. **I've been there before.** What most of these projects have in common apart
   from all being paystack related tooling, is that i try to make sure that they
   are easy to use by providing detailed documentation because it's what I
   noticed most similar packages lacked. Nevertheless, the efforts of these
   other package authors should not be discredited as these endeavors are no
   easy feats
