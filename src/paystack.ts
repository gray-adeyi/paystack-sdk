/**
 * PaystackClient has other dedicated clients bound to it. This provides a convenience for interacting
 * with all of paystack's endpoints in your JS/TS project. As stated above, it has other dedicated clients bound to it as
 * class properties, therefore, after creating an instance of PaystackClient. You can access the associated
 * methods of each dedicated client via its property name. e.g.to get supported banks, you access the `getBanks`
 * method of the `MiscellaneousClient` via the `miscellaneous` property. i.e. `paystackClientInstance.miscellaneous.getBanks`.
 * To create a new customer on your integration, you access the `create` method of the `CustomerClient` via the `customers`
 * property. i.e. `paystackClientInstance.customers.create`.
